              provide free clinical tests consisting of basic diagnosis of the patient along with free essential medicines to ones who
              cannot afford it. Currently the scheme is being operated in nearby villages but with tireless efforts and dedication of

              of the poor and needy people are benefitted under this programme.

              Seeing the tremendous support of locals towards this initiative, we decided to protrude this mission on higher level
              where student volunteers from NIT Silchar visit schools in villages of Cachar to provide the benefits of this scheme to
              maximum possible students.The program is held twice an year where students from class 6th to higher secondary are
              taught.
              With upcoming version of the program, we are going to launch a Teaching manual for our volunteers which will consist of
              guidelines to be followed by them regarding syllabus and time table for commencement of various classes.
